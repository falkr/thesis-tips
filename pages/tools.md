## Use LaTeX

For scientific writing, LaTeX is pretty much standard, and  most theses and scientific articles are written with it. 

There is a learning curve, as you need to understand some of the LaTeX language. However, there is also lots of help available on the web. For your needs, standard templates and styles should work quite well. 

One of the benefits of LaTeX, apart from its high-quality output, is the fact that it uses normal text files as input, which simplifies versioning and backup. You can for instance use Git both for taking care of incremental changes and as additional backup. You can also use any text editor of your choice.
